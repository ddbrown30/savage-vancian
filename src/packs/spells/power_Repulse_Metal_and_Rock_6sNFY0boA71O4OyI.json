    "description": "This spell fills an area the size of a Huge Cone Template with waves of rolling energy, causing all metal and stone objects (which also includes objects with metal and/or stone parts) to be pushed away from the point where the spell was initially cast. Objects firmly fixed to the ground are unaffected if they are larger than 3 inches in diameter, but bend or shatter if they are smaller.\n Loose objects are repelled at the rate of 8\" per round, up to the limit of the spell, unless they weight more than 500 pounds. Creatures carrying or wearing metal or stone objects must make a Strength roll at -2 (or -4 if the spell was cast with a raise), on a failure they are dragged along with their objects; if the objects are held the creature may choose to drop them, but this decision must be made before making the Strength roll. If the creature succeeds at their Strength roll, their Pace is still halved while moving through the area, unless they rolled a raise.\n The effect of this spell is applied when the spell is first cast, at the beginning of the caster's turn on all subsequent rounds, and immediately whenever a\n\ncreature or object enters the area. If cast against a solid surface such as a wall, creatures and objects can be pinned in place until they succeed a Strength roll.",
