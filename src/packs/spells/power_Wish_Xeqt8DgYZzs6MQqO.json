    "description": "This incredibly powerful spell allows the caster to alter reality in one specific way, chosen when the spell is cast. Wish can duplicate any other Mage spell of up to Heroic rank, or any other spell of up to Veteran rank. It can create a magical or non- magical item with a value of up to 25,000 gp, or add a permanent enchantment of the same value to an existing item. It can revive the dead (as if casting Resurrect), or teleport up to 3 creatures per caster rank to anywhere else on the same plane of\n\nexistence. It can remove one specific type of injury or affliction from up to 3 creatures per caster rank, or force a reroll of any roll made within the last round. Other options may also be available at the GM's discretion, although greedy wishes have a tendency to be twisted. Unwilling recipients of a wish may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll.\n When duplicating a spell with a spell component costing more than 10,000 gp, that component must be provided as well.",
