    "description": "This spell conjures a stone wall consisting of up to\n3 sections per caster rank, each of which are 1\" square and have Toughness 10 (the caster may instead choose to conjure twice the number of sections each with Toughness 5). The wall can be created in almost any shape the caster wishes (including bridges, ramps, even crude battlements with crenellations), but must be able to merge with an existing rock surface, and the sections must all be connected to each other. If the caster attempts to entrap a creature within or under a stone wall, they may attempt to evade with an opposed Agility roll.\n The wall is only assembled through magic, it cannot be dispelled and it lasts indefinitely.",
