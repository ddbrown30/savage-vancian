    "description": "This spell protects you from the next spell cast upon you, reflecting it back upon its caster. The Spell Reflection is automatically discharged the next time you are personally targeted by a spell (rather than just being caught within an area effect): make an opposed spellcasting roll against the spell, on a failure you are affected normally, on a success the spell is reflected back on the caster, and a raise further indicates that the Spell Reflection remains active instead of ending after being discharged.\n If you reflect the spell back on the original caster, and they are also protected by Spell Reflection, they must make another spellcasting roll to oppose yours. On a failure the spell hits them, on a tie the spell affects both of you, and if they win the spell drains away. On a critical failure, both of you are dragged through a rift into another plane of existence.",
