    "description": "This spell targets one creature: roll 2d10 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate the target, they are immediately turned to stone along with their equipment, otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they are either petrified or nothing happens).\n If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to avoid being turned to stone. Creatures without flesh are not affected by this spell.",
