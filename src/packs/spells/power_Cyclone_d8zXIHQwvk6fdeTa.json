    "description": "This spell creates a cyclone of raging wind that fills a Small Burst Template. The cyclone has Pace\n\n12, and you can move it as a free action on the round that you create it. Each subsequent round, the cyclone moves again on your turn: you can concentrate on precisely controlling its movement as a normal action, otherwise it repeats the same movement as the previous round.\n Anyone the cyclone passes over (including those in the area where the spell is first cast) must make a Strength roll (at -2 if the spell was cast with a raise); on a failure, the creature is knocked 2d6\" in a random direction and falls Prone. If they strike a solid surface other than the ground, they also become Shaken. This spell cannot affect the same creature more than once in the same turn.\n If the cyclone exceeds the spell range, you lose control of it; it moves in a random direction each turn until you draw Clubs for initiative, at which point it dissipates. You cannot regain control of the cyclone, even if it later moves back into range.",
