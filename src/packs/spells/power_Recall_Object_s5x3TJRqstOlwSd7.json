    "description": "This spell must be cast on an object upon which you've already placed your Arcane Signature, and requires a gem to serve as a link to the object. When you speak the command word (chosen when the spell is cast) and crush the gem, the object is immediately transported to your hand regardless of distance, even if it is on another plane of existence.\n\n If another creature owns the object then the spell fails, but you immediately know the identity and location of the creature.\n The gem is invisibly marked with the name of the object, but only the caster can read the name or summon the object.",
