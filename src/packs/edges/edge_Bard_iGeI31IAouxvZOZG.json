You gain the Command Edge, representing your ability to inspire people with your songs - you must sing or play an instrument in order to use Command, but the benefits apply to all allies within range, rather than just subordinates. The same trapping extends to any other Leadership Edges you take. If you take Tactician, you should replace the Knowledge (Battle) requirement with Knowledge (Bardic Lore).\nIf you wish to take Jack-of-all-Trades, you may ignore its Smarts requirement. If you wish to take Attractive and Very Attractive during play, you can have it represent the attraction of your growing celebrity status.</p></div>",
