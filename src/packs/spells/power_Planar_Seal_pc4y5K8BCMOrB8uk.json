    "description": "This spell requires one minute to cast, and wards an area the size of a Small, Medium or Large Burst Template, chosen when the spell is cast. The size of the area determines the cost of the components, and two overlapping Planar Seals will merge together to cover a larger area.\n All forms of extradimensional movement are blocked within the area, as well as from passing through the area in either direction. This doesn't affect ethereal creatures who were already within the area when the spell is cast, nor does it prevent summoned creatures from vanishing when their spell expires.\n Any creatures entering the area after the spell is cast must make a Spirit roll at -2 or suffer 2d8 damage, unless both you and they have identical allegiance abilities (Holy, Unholy, Lawful and/or Chaotic).\n You may specify a secret passphrase when you cast this spell if you wish: this increases the cost of the components by 50%, but those speaking the phrase when they enter the area do not suffer any damage.",
