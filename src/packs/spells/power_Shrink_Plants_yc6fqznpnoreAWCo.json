    "description": "If this spell is cast directly on a plant creature, it may attempt to resist with an opposed Vigor roll if it wishes; on a failure, its size temporarily decreases by one category, or two categories on a raise. Each size category decreases the creature's Strength by 2 die steps and its Toughness by 2, but it also gains a +1 bonus to all attacks, and attacks against it suffer a -1 penalty to hit. Any equipment the creature is carrying is also shrunk for the duration of the spell, or until it leaves their person. This does not stack with other spells or magical effects that increase size.\n Alternatively, this spell can be used to permanently affect the surrounding terrain. When focused on the local area, all normal vegetation within range becomes untangled and appears pruned; it can be moved through without penalty. If the spell isn't focused on the local area, it instead depletes all normal vegetation within half a mile, decreasing its productivity for the current year.",
