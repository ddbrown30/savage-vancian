    "description": "This spell is treated as a touch attack (i.e., if successfully cast, add +2 to the result and compare against the target's Parry to see if you hit, the +2 doesn't apply to the opposed roll): if you hit a living creature, they can try to resist with an opposed Spirit roll. If they fail to resist, their Smarts and Spirit are each reduced by 1 die step (to a minimum of d4-2) and their Charisma by 1 (to a minimum of -2), while beating them with a raise reduces their Smarts, Spirit and Charisma by 2.",
