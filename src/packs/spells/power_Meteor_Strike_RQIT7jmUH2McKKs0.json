    "description": "This spell shoots four fiery meteors, each of which fills a Large Burst Template; those who fail to evade with an opposed Agility roll suffer 2d4 damage (one die is considered bludgeoning damage, the other fire, and on a raise the bonus die should also be considered fire damage). Roll for flammable targets to see if they catch fire.\n The caster may fully or partially overlap the Burst Templates if they wish. Those caught within the area of multiple meteors only require a single Agility roll to evade them all, and there is only one damage roll per target, but the damage dice are increased to 2d6, 2d8 or 2d10 when the target is caught within the area of two, three or four meteors respectively.",
