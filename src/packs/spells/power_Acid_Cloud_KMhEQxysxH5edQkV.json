There is a -6 penalty for attacking someone within the fog, although the penalty is reduced to -2 if they are adjacent. When first cast, and at the beginning of your turn on each subsequent round, everyone within the fog must make a Vigor roll (at -2 if cast with a raise) or suffer 2d6 damage.\n</p></div>",
