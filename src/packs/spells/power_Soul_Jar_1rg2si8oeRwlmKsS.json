    "description": "This spell must be cast on a gem, into which your soul is immediately transferred. While your soul is in the gem you gain the ability to sense the\n\napproximate location and strength of other life forces within range. Your own body appears lifeless until you return to it.\n You may attempt to possess the body of any life force within range as a full-round action. The victim can attempt to resist with a standard Spirit roll (at -2 if you cast this spell with a raise), and if they succeed you cannot target them again with this casting of the spell. If they fail the Spirit roll, you take control of their body, and their soul is moved to the gem.\n While possessing a host body you retain your own Smarts, Spirit, skills and mental abilities, but gain their physical attributes, stats and abilities in place of your own. You may leave a host body as a normal action, returning to the gem and sending their soul back to their body. If the host is killed while within range of the gem, you return to the gem and their soul departs. When the spell ends, your soul returns to your body, and any soul within the gem returns to its body.\n The range of this spell represents the greatest distance a soul can travel between gem and body. If a soul is forced to leave its body or the gem, and its destination is beyond the range of this spell, the soul departs (i.e., dies). Similarly, if your body has been killed, your soul cannot return to it, and departs when the spell ends. Destroying or dispelling the gem ends the spell and sends any souls back to their bodies (if within range).",
