    "description": "This spell creates a gateway to another plane of existence of your choice. You must choose the orientation, facing and size of the gateway when you cast the spell: it can be 1\" disk, or the size of a Small or Medium Burst Template. Anyone can pass through the gateway in either direction, and using the spell in this way does not cost a benny.\n However if you spend a benny and name either a specific individual or a type of creature when casting this spell, the gateway opens in front of them and automatically pulls them through, closing again immediately afterwards. Only extremely powerful beings such as deities can resist the pull, although they may still choose to pass through the gateway if they wish.\n If a creature is pulled through the gateway and its rank does not exceed yours, you may force it to perform a service for you. A service that requires more than a few minutes to complete requires negotiation and bargaining; once the creature has completed its task it is automatically transported to your location, and if you fail to fulfill your side of the bargain the consequences will be dire - you might lose your life or even your soul, or be forced into performing a service for the creature or its master. If you complete your side of the bargain, the creature automatically returns to its home plane.\n If the creature's rank exceeds yours, is free to do whatever it wishes. It can return to its own plane at any time, but may choose to have some fun first.",
