    "description": "This spell requires one hour to cast, and allows you to remotely view the target creature with your normal senses, unless they resist with an opposed Spirit roll (at +2 if they are on another plane of existence). If the target wins the opposed roll, you cannot attempt to scry on them again for 24 hours. If you beat them with a raise, you can use the following spells through the scrying sensor: Sense Chaos, Sense Evil, Sense Good, Sense Law, Sense Magic, and Whispered Message. The scrying sensor has Pace 30, and follows the target if they move.\n You receive one of the following modifiers to the opposed roll, depending on how well you know the target: -4 if you know nothing about them, -2 if you've heard of them but have never met them, +0 if you've met them, or +2 if you know them well.\n You also receive one of the following modifiers for a sympathetic link (use the highest if more than one applies): +4 if you have a piece of the target (such as a drop of their blood or a lock of their hair), +2 if you have one of their possessions or garments, +1 if you have a picture or likeness of them, otherwise +0.\n This spell usually requires a silver mirror worth 1,000 gp as a spell focus. A priest instead requires a holy water font worth 100 gp, while a shaman requires a natural pool of water.",
