    "description": "This spell creates an unmoving sphere of force the size of a Medium Burst Template, with its lower hemisphere passing through the ground. The sphere provides some degree of protection against the elements, granting a +2 bonus to resist Heat- and Cold-based environmental hazards, and automatically keeping out rain and wind (although hurricane force winds will destroy the shelter). Everything else (including creatures, attacks and spells) can pass through the sphere as if it were intangible.\n The shelter appears opaque from the outside but transparent from the inside, and may be dimly illuminated on command. It can hold up to ten medium-sized occupants at a time, including the caster, but the spell ends immediately if the caster leaves.",
