    "description": "This spell causes flames with the same brightness and intensity as a torch to appear in your hand. The flames cause no damage to you or your equipment, but inflict Str+d6 damage if used to make an unarmed attack (although they don't count as a weapon for the purposes of the Unarmed Defender rule). The flames can also be thrown with a range of 3/6/12, inflicting Str+d6 damage. After throwing the flames, a new set of flames immediately appear in your hand.",
