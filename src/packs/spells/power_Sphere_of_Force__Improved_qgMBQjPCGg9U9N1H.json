    "description": "This spell creates a sphere of shimmering force the size of a Small Burst Template; those within the area can attempt to evade with an opposed Agility roll. The sphere can only be destroyed with a targeted Dispel Magic or a Disintegration spell. Nothing can pass into or out of the sphere, although creatures inside can still breathe normally. As a normal action you can telekinetically move the sphere up to 6\" along the ground or through the air, as long as you are within 24\" and its contents doesn't weigh more than 5,000 pounds. If you don't concentrate on moving the sphere on your turn while it is up in the air, it will float downward at the rate of 12\" per turn until it lands on a surface or you start concentrating again, however it moves too slowly to cause any damage to the creature within, and is generally too light to cause any damage to those it lands on. Nothing\nelse can cause the sphere to move.\n The telekinetic nature of the sphere gives it an effective weight equal to 5% of its contents. For example if the sphere contains a creature weighing 200 pounds, it actually weighs only 5 pounds.",
