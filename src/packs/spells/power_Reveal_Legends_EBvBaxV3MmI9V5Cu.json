    "description": "This spell allows you to learn legends (including those that have been forgotten or were never generally known) about an important person, object or place.\n If the target is present, the spell requires 6 minutes to cast, or 3 minutes on a raise. If you have detailed information about the target but they are not present, the casting time is in days rather than minutes, and the information is less complete. If you only know rumors about the target (and they are not present) then the casting time is in weeks, and the information is even more vague.\n You can only perform routine activities while casting this spell, and it only works if the target is considered to be of legendary importance (GM's discretion).",
