    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and targets a single inanimate corpse, which must be reasonably intact and physically capable of speech; the corpse may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll, but it only does this if it would have viewed you as an enemy in life. The target is temporarily imbued with the semblance of life, and forced to answer one question per caster rank, or two questions per caster rank on a raise.\n The corpse is limited to whatever it knew in life, and its answers tend to be brief and cryptic, but it cannot lie. Casting this spell also renders the corpse immune to further castings of Interrogate the Dead for a period of one week.",
