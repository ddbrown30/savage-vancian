Anyone wishing to directly attack the creature must first make a Spirit roll to breach the Aggression Ward: if successful they are unaffected by this casting of the spell, while on a failure they cannot directly attack the creature for the duration of the spell (although this does not consume their action). Aggression Ward does not protect against area-effect attacks, tricks, tests of will, etc., only against direct attacks (including melee, ranged, spells, etc.).\n If the target creature makes any violent actions of their own, the spell ends immediately.\n</p></div>",
