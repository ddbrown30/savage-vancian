    "description": "This spell allows you to change the physical appearance of any number of creatures within a Large Burst Template, including their equipment; unwilling creatures may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll. You can make individuals appear however you wish, and on a raise the illusion can also include auditory, tactile, olfactory and thermal elements (this can change the pitch and timbre of voices, but not accents or the actual words that are spoken). If you want to give someone the appearance of a specific individual, this spell grants a +2 bonus to the disguise roll.",
