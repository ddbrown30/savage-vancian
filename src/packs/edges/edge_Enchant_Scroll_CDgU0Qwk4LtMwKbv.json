Scrolls have a rank-specific price of 50 gp, and the same type of magic (i.e., arcane or divine) as their spell.\nThey must be readied (like a weapon) before they can be used, and this requires both hands.\nIf you are not the creator of a scroll you wish to use, you must have already cast Decipher Magic on it, and wield the same type of magic (arcane or divine) as its spell. The spell must also be on the spell list for your Spellcaster type, unless you are a Spellwright (they can cast any spell from a scroll, but nobody else can use the scrolls they create).\nYou must a spellcasting roll to cast a spell from a scroll. This uses your own spellcasting skill, but you use the caster rank of the scroll rather than your own caster rank. If the scroll has a higher caster rank than you, apply a -1 penalty to the roll for each rank of difference. After casting a spell from a scroll, the words (and magic) fade away.</p></div>",
