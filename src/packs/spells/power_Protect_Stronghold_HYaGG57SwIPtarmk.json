    "description": "This spell requires half an hour to cast, and wards an area of up to 20 1x1\" sections per caster rank, each with a height of up to 3\". The sections can be divided up as you see fit, although they must all be within the same physical building. You must be within the building when you cast the spell, and must be familiar with the layout of the affected sections.\n You can apply as many of the following spells as you wish to any or all affected sections of the building: Obscuring Fog within corridors, Secure Locks on doors, Illusionary Images (of walls) over doorways, Webs within staircases, and a specialized Confuse at junctions (those affected have a 50% chance of believing they took a different direction from the one they actually took).\n You may also apply one of the following standard options: two Ghostly Lights (in different locations), one Illusionary Mouth, or one Stinking Cloud. If you cast the spell with a raise, you can either pick two standard options (including taking the same option twice), or one of the following advanced options: Blast of Wind, or Suggestion.",
