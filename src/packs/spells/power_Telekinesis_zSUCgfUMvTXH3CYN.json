    "description": "This spell allows you to move things with your mind, although you can only concentrate on one target each round. You can move an object up to 4\", as long as it remains within range and its weight doesn't exceed 75 pounds per caster rank. If the object is attended, its owner can attempt to resist with an opposed Strength roll. If you lift the object into the air, it remains floating until your next turn; if you don't concentrate on it again it will then fall.\n You can use Telekinesis to perform physical actions at range, including attacks and the push maneuver, as well as actions such as picking locks, opening doors, pulling levers, and so on. These actions are resolved exactly as normal, except you can perform them anywhere within range, and roll Spirit in place of Strength. If you successfully grapple a creature using Telekinesis, you can then move it 4\" each round as if it were an object.\n Alternatively, when you first cast this spell you can choose to expend all of its energy at once. This allows you to throw any number of creatures and objects within a Small Burst Template at a single target within range, as long as no individual creature or object weighs more than 75 pounds per caster rank. Those you throw may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll, while the target can attempt to evade with an opposed Agility roll. A solid impact typically causes 2d6 damage to each of the thrown creatures and objects, and 2d8 damage to the target (total, not per impact), with a raise on the opposed roll inflicting a further +d6 damage.",
