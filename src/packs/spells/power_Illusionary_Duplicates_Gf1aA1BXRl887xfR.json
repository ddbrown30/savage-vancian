    "description": "This spell conjures multiple illusionary duplicates of you, which constantly move around and through you, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. All attacks made against you that rely on vision suffer a -2 penalty, even those that are incorporeal.\n You conjure two duplicates (or four on a raise), plus one additional duplicate per caster rank. Whenever an attack misses you because of this spell, one of the duplicates is struck and destroyed instead. When all of the duplicates have been destroyed, the spell ends.",
