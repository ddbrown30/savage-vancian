Wands have a rank-specific price of 1,500 gp, always contain a single spell, and must be readied (like a weapon) before they can be used.\nCasting a spell from a wand is resolved in the same way as casting the spell normally, except that it uses Smarts instead of the spellcasting skill if the spell isn't on your spell list. This expends 1 charge.\nEach wand has 50 charges when first created, but cannot be recharged; the magic fades when the last charge is expended.\nIf the spell requires an expensive component, you must multiply the component cost by 50 (i.e., each charge requires its own component).</p></div>",
