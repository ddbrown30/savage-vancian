    "description": "This spell creates an invisible aura around you, the size of a Small, Medium or Large Burst Template, chosen when the spell is cast. Any creature within the aura when the spell is cast, or attempting to enter the aura afterwards, must make a Spirit roll at -2 (or at -4 on a raise): on a failure they cannot move towards you for the duration of the spell.\n Those affected by this spell can still move around you or away from you, they just can't voluntarily move closer to you while within the aura (although they can still be pushed or moved by others). If you approach them they are not forced back, and they can still attack you normally if they can reach you.",
