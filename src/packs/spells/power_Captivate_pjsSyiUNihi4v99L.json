Uncooperative and Hostile creatures receive a +2 and +4 bonus to their Spirit rolls respectively.\n The spell only lasts as long as you continue to speak or sing. Those affected typically stand still and perform no actions for the duration of the spell, but if any are attacked or threatened, the spell ends immediately.\n Unaffected creatures can attempt to break the hold of the spell by jeering as a full-round action: affected creatures can break free with a standard Spirit roll (at -2 if cast with a raise). Those who fail do not receive another chance, even if the jeering continues.\n</p></div>",
