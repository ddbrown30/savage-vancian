    "description": "This spell transforms natural earth within an area the size of a Small Burst Template into loose dirt or thick mud, while natural rock becomes soft clay. The size of the area increases to a Medium or Large Burst Template at Seasoned and Veteran caster rank respectively. The maximum depth affected by this spell is one foot of rock or two feet of earth, or twice that on a raise.\n\n Loose dirt and thick mud are treated as Difficult Ground. Soft clay does not affect movement, but it can be worked far more easily than rock, and may cause cave ceilings and cliff faces to collapse.",
