    "description": "This spell is treated as a touch attack (i.e., if successfully cast, add +2 to the result and compare against the target's Parry to see if you hit, the +2 doesn't apply to the opposed roll): if you hit the target, they must make an opposed Spirit roll or begin to dance. This spell only affects living creatures, and expires when the target next draws Hearts for initiative.\n Dancing is a normal action. The character may perform other actions as well (except for running), but doing so will inflict the standard multi-action penalty. Normal movement is still a free action, although the character will caper and prance as they move around.",
