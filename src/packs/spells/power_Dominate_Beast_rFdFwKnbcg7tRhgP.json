    "description": "This spell targets a single animal, who may attempt to resist with a Spirit roll (at -2 if the spell is cast with a raise). If successful, you can command the animal to perform simple actions (no more than one or two words), as long as those actions aren't obviously suicidal. If you command the animal to perform an action that goes against its nature, it can make an immediate unmodified Spirit roll to break the spell.\n The telepathic link formed by this spell allows you to issue new commands as a normal action, as long as the animal remains within range. You can also concentrate on the animal as a normal action to\n\nreceive a rough idea of what it's currently experiencing, although you don't receive sensory input.",
