    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast and restores life to a willing creature that has been dead no more than 30 years per caster rank, as long as at least some part of them remains (even the fine dust left after a Disintegration spell is sufficient). Non-magical poisons and diseases are cured, the creature is no longer incapacitated, wounded or bleeding out, and all injuries (including permanent ones) are restored, but the creature permanently loses an advance. This spell doesn't work on Constructs, Elementals, Outsiders, Undead (unless destroyed first), or creatures who died of old age.",
