    "description": "This spell automatically affects one living creature: roll 2d12 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate the target, they immediately die, otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they either die or nothing happens). If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to survive.\n You may spend bennies to reroll the damage for this spell, as if you had the No Mercy Edge.",
