You project yourself into the astral plane while your physical body falls into a state of suspended animation. You may also affect up to one additional willing creature per caster rank, or twice that many on a raise, however they must accompany you, they cannot travel independently through the astral plane.\n An astral body is a duplicate of the physical body, complete with equipment, and is connected to the physical body with a silvery cord. If the cord is broken then the body dies, however very few things are capable of damaging the cord, and only the sections of cord within a few feet of either body can be perceived or attacked.\n While using this spell, it is possible to enter any other plane that touches the astral plane, including the material plane. When this happens your astral form materialize as a new physical body, complete with equipment.\n If an astral or materialized body is killed, the cord returns to its physical body and the spell ends for that individual; the trauma causes the creature to permanently lose an advance.\n The caster may end the spell at any time, and it can also be dispelled, or ended by killing the true body, but otherwise there is no limit on the duration. Any equipment removed from the true body also vanishes from the astral or materialized body.\n</p></div>",
