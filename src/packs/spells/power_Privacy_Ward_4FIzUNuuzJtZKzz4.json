    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and wards an area the size of a Small, Medium or Large Burst Template, chosen when the spell is cast. The area appears dark and foggy from the outside, and cannot be penetrated even with magical vision, scrying, or detection spells, although anyone can enter or leave the area freely.\n \nThose within the area can see normally, with the border of the spell only barely visible as a faint swirling of shadowy mist. Any sounds made within the area cannot be heard outside, although sound originating from outside can still be heard within the area.",
