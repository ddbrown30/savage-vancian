    "description": "This spell conjures a ghostly hand from your own life force, allowing you to deliver touch spells of up to Seasoned rank as if you had a reach equal to the range of the spell. The hand swoops forward to make each touch attack, then floats back and hovers by your side, but it never provokes free attacks, nor does it provide a Gang Up bonus.\n While this spell is active, your Toughness is reduced by 1. The hand has Toughness 1, but all\n\nattacks made against it suffer a -2 penalty to hit, and it can only be harmed by attacks that damage incorporeal creatures.\n If the hand is Shaken or wounded the spell ends immediately, and you automatically become Shaken (this can cause a wound).",
