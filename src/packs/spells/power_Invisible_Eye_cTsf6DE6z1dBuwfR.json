    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and creates an invisible floating sensor the size of your eyeball. The sensor must appear at a point you can see when the spell is cast, but after that it can leave your line of sight. You must concentrate on the sensor as a normal action to use it: this allows you to move the sensor with Pace 6, and see everything it sees (as if you were standing in its place) until the beginning of your next turn. The sensor only provides visual feedback, and cannot move through solid objects or enter another plane of existence.",
