    "description": "This spell targets any number of creatures within a Small Burst Template; those targeted may attempt to resist with a standard Spirit roll (at -2 if cast with a raise). On a failure they become Dazed, and their attitude improves by two steps until they\n\nrecover from being Dazed. If you make a brief and reasonable request of them before they recover, the creature retains their attitude towards that one request even after they recover from being Dazed.\n If this spell is used during combat, the targets receive a +1 bonus to resist. If you choose to target only one creature, it suffers a -1 penalty to resist. Only creatures who can see or hear you are affected by this spell. Those who fail their Spirit roll do not remember that you hypnotized them.",
