    "description": "This spell targets one creature: roll 2d10 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate the target, they are immediately polymorphed into a Small animal of your choice, otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they are either polymorphed or nothing happens).\n If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to survive. If the new form would prove fatal (for example, transforming someone into a fish while they're on dry land) they receive a +2 bonus to their Soak roll.\n The target retains their Smarts and Spirit, along with any skills linked to those attributes, but replaces all of their other stats and abilities with those of the new form. After 24 hours in the new form, the creature must make a Spirit roll (at -2 if the spell was cast with a raise); on a failure they lose their memories and become an animal mentally as well as physically.\n Incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, and creatures capable of shapechanging can revert back to their true form at any time as a normal action.",
