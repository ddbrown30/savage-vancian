    "description": "This spell targets one creature: roll 2d10 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate the target, they become permanently Confused, otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they are either cursed or nothing happens).\n If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to resist this spell, however the Soak roll must be made with Spirit rather than Vigor.\n The confusion caused by this spell is permanent; drawing a Joker or spending a benny on Spades only suppresses the confusion for the current scene. Only Heal, Limited Wish, Miracle, Restore Major Vitality or Wish can remove the effects of this spell.",
