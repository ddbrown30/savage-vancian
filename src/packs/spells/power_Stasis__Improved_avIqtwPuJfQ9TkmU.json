    "description": "This spell is treated as a touch attack (i.e., if successfully cast, add +2 to the result and compare against the target's Parry to see if you hit): if you hit the target, they must make a Spirit roll (at -2 if you cast the spell with a raise) to resist being banished outside of time and space. If you know the target's true name and some private details about them, they receive a further -2 penalty to the Spirit roll.\n Time ceases to flow for a creature affected by this spell; the target does not age, and cannot be harmed in any way until they return. The location where the spell was cast can only be found with Find Location, Wish or Miracle, and the creature can only be freed by casting Freedom at that specific location.",
