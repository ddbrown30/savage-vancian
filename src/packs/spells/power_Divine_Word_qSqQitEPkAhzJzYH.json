    "description": "This spell fills a Large Burst Template centered on you. Everyone within the area who can hear you speak may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll, on a failure they become Dazed, and are rendered deaf until they next draw Hearts for initiative. If you win the opposed roll with one or more raises, the victim also becomes Confused and suffers one wound per raise.\n If you are on your home plane when this spell is cast, Extraplanar creatures who fail their Spirit roll are also banished back to their home plane, even if they can't hear you speak.\n The trapping of this spell (Holy, Unholy, Lawful or Chaotic) is determined by the Sphere of magic used to cast the spell. If cast as a Priest spell rather than a Sphere spell, the trapping is Holy if you have the Turn Undead Edge, and Unholy if you have the Rebuke Undead (if you have neither Edge, you cannot cast this spell).\n Creatures with the same ability type as the trapping are immune to this spell.",
