    "description": "This spell requires a full round to cast, and increases the size of up to three humanoid creatures per caster rank, who may attempt to resist with an opposed Vigor roll if they wish. Each creature's Strength increases by +2 die steps and their Toughness by +2, but they suffer a -1 penalty to all attacks, and attacks against them receive a\n+1 bonus to hit. If cast with a raise, these modifiers may be doubled if the caster wishes. If any of the creatures are constrained or have insufficient space to grow, they are unaffected by this spell. Any equipment the creatures are carrying is also enlarged for the duration of the spell, or until it leaves their person.",
