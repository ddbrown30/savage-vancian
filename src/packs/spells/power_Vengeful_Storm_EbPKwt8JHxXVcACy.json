    "description": "This spell must be cast outdoors, and causes a\nstorm cloud to appear in the sky directly above you, affecting everyone within an area 60\" in radius (those further out may still get a little wet, but they don't suffer the effects described here).\n On the turn you cast the spell, everyone within the area must make a standard Vigor roll or be deafened for ten minutes by the crashing thunder. On your second turn, everyone within the area suffers 2d4 acid damage from acid rain. On the third round, you can strike up to six different targets in the area with lightning; each target may attempt to evade with an Agility roll at -2, if they fail they suffer 2d10 electricity damage. On the fourth round, everyone within the area suffers 2d6 damage from pelting hailstones.\n After the fourth round and for the remainder of the duration, powerful wind and pelting rain greatly reduce visibility; there is a -4 Obscurement penalty for attacking someone within the area, although the penalty is reduced to -2 if they are adjacent. The area is also treated as Difficult Ground.",
