    "description": "This spell targets one living creature: roll 2d8 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate the target, they immediately become either blind or deaf (your choice), otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they are either blinded or deafened, or nothing happens). If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to resist the spell.",
