    "description": "This spell creates a melee weapon of shimmering force, which immediately attacks one specified target within range. You can telepathically change the target as a normal action, otherwise it continues attacking its current target each round. If there is no valid target, the weapon hovers beside you.\n Treat the weapon as an Extra with d6 in all attributes and Fighting d6. It can only perform standard attacks, inflicting 2d6 damage. The weapon doesn't provide or benefit from Gang Up, nor does it provoke a free attack if it withdraws from combat. It can follow its target anywhere within range as a free action.\n The appearance of the weapon depends on the caster and/or their deity, but is fixed for each individual, and the appearance is purely cosmetic (i.e., all Spirit Weapons inflict Str+d6 damage). The weapon cannot be Shaken or damaged, but can be dispelled, and is automatically destroyed by Disintegration.",
