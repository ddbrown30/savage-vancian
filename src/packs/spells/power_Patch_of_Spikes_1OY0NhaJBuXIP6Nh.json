    "description": "This spell must be cast on a stone floor or a patch of rocky ground, and it affects an area the size of a Large Burst Template. Sharp spikes of stone project from the ground as people move within the area, inflicting 2d6 damage to those who fail an Agility roll at -2. This roll only needs to be made once per round, and only by those who move. The area is also treated as Difficult Ground.",
