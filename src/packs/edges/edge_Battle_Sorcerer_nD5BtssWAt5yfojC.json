Reduce your chance of Arcane Spell Failure by 1 (even if you're only using a shield).\nAs a free action, you may expend a daily spell to temporarily enchant one weapon you are wielding, (including natural weapons). The weapon is treated as magical with a standard enchantment equal to the rank of the spell you just expended (i.e., no bonus for a Cantrip, +1 for a Novice spell, +2 for a Seasoned spell, etc.); see the 'Magic Arms and Armor' section for further details. This bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn.\nBattle Sorcerers cannot take the Arcane Lineage Edge; they are too focused on their military skills to research their inner mysteries.</p></div>",
