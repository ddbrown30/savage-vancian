    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and allows you to control and manipulate the weather conditions within range, as long as your changes are appropriate to the current climate and season. You can create fog, rain and storms, control the direction and intensity of the wind, and so on, but cannot direct specific applications such as the path of a tornado or the location of a lightning strike. Changing the weather is a normal action, however it takes ten minutes before your changes take effect (i.e., you can increase or decrease the wind by one category every ten minutes).",
