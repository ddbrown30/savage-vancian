    "description": "This spell allows you to issue a single command to one living creature, who may attempt to resist with a Spirit roll (at -2 if cast with a raise). If the spell is successful, the creature will attempt to obey your command on its turn. The five commands you may choose from are as follows:\n Approach: The creature moves towards you as quickly as possible for the duration of the spell, it will run if necessary but cannot perform any other actions.\n Drop: The creature drops whatever is holding as a free action, and cannot pick up the dropped item or items for the duration of the spell, although it may otherwise act normally.\n Fall: The creature falls Prone and cannot stand up for the duration of the spell, although it may otherwise act normally.\n Flee: The creature moves away from you as quickly as possible for the duration of the spell, it will run if necessary but cannot perform any other actions.\n Halt: The creature remains in place for the duration of the spell, it does not move and cannot perform any actions.",
