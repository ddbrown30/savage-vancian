    "description": "This spell creates an illusionary duplicate of you within range (including superimposed over your own body if you wish) and simultaneously turns you invisible; attacks and Notice rolls against you are made with a -4 penalty. You may perform offensive actions without ending the spell or turning visible.\n Your illusionary duplicate can move and talk, and even pretend to attack or cast spells (although it is only an illusion and not capable of actual spellcasting). Controlling your illusionary duplicate is a free action on the round you cast this spell, and a normal action on subsequent rounds. If you don't control the duplicate, it will continue doing whatever it did on the previous round.",
