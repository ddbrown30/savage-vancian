    "description": "This spell targets up to one undead creature per caster rank within an area the size of a Large Burst Template: roll 2d8 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise, and apply the result to each target. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate a target, they are immediately destroyed, otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they are either destroyed or nothing happens). If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to survive.\n\n You may spend bennies to reroll the damage for this spell, as if you had the No Mercy Edge.",
