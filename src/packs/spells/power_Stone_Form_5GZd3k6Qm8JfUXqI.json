    "description": "This spell requires a full round to cast, and transforms the target creature along with their gear into solid stone. While in their stone form, the creature doesn't need to eat, drink or breathe, attack rolls against them don't inflict any additional damage on a raise or Called Shot, and damage rolls against them don't ace. However their Parry is reduced to 2, and they cannot move or perform any physical actions, nor can they evade attacks or spells that require an Agility roll (treat them as if they'd rolled 2 for the purposes of opposed rolls).\n The creature can return to their normal form as a free action, and reassume their stone form again as another free action, as often as they wish for the duration of the spell. They can even assume their normal form at the beginning of their turn, take their actions, and then turn back to stone afterwards, although foes can attempt to interrupt them as normal.",
