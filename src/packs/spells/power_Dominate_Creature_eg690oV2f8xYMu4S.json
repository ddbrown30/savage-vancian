    "description": "This spell targets any one creature, who may attempt to resist with a Spirit roll (at -2 if the spell is cast with a raise). If successful, you can command the creature to perform certain actions, as long as those action aren't obviously suicidal. If you command the creature to perform an action that goes against their nature, they can make an immediate unmodified Spirit roll to break the spell.\n The telepathic link formed by this spell allows you to issue new commands as a normal action, regardless of distance. You can also concentrate on the creature as a normal action to receive sensory input from their mind, although this doesn't allow direct communication, nor can you use their senses directly; you only get a second-hand impression of what they currently sense and feel.\n If you don't share a common language with the target creature, you can only issue very basic commands (no more than one or two words), and cannot receive sensory input from their mind.",
