    "description": "This spell targets a single creature, who then radiates a protective aura the size of a Small Burst Template. All creatures within the area gain the benefit of a Protection from Chaos spell, and summoned creatures can only enter the area if they have the Lawful ability.\n Alternatively, the ward can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, this spell binds a non-Lawful called creature (such as those called by Planar Summoning) for up to 3 days per caster rank, preventing it from leaving or reaching through the ward. The creature must be called within one round of casting the ward in order to bind it.\n A bound creature with Magic Resistance may attempt to break free once per day by making an opposed Spirit roll against the spellcasting roll used to cast this spell (at -2 if you spend ten minutes securing the ward before casting the spell). If the creature has a dimensional travel ability (such as Flicker, Teleportation, etc.) it can use it to escape the ward, unless prevented through some other means (such as Dimensional Manacles). The creature can also make ranged attacks out of the ward, although it cannot attack the ward itself. Other creatures can easily break the ward, freeing the creature.",
