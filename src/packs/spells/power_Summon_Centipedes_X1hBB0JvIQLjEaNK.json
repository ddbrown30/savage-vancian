    "description": "This spell summons one centipede swarm per caster rank, each of which can be placed anywhere within range. The swarms can overlap, but the overlapping area only counts as one swarm for the purposes of attacking (i.e., each covered creature can only be attacked by one swarm each round).\n If the spell is cast with a raise, the swarms attack on the round they are summoned, otherwise they don't start attacking until your next turn. The swarms automatically attack everyone they cover\n\nat the end of your turn each round, even you if you're not careful.\n You can move any or all of the swarms up to their normal Pace each round as a normal action, as long as they don't exceed twice the range of this spell, otherwise they remain stationary.",
