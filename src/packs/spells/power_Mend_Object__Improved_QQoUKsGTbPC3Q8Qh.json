    "description": "This spell repairs a single inanimate object of up to thirty cubic feet per caster rank, as if the spellcasting roll were actually a Repair roll (with no modifiers for tools or a lack thereof). It can fully repair damaged objects, but cannot repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, melted or vaporized. It is possible to repair magic items, but this doesn't restore their magical abilities.",
