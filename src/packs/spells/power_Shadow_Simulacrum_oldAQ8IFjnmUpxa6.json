    "description": "This spell requires 12 hours to cast, and creates a quasi-real duplicate of one specific creature, formed from extradimensional energy. The Simulacrum is always an Extra and only has half as many advances as the original creature, it never advances and cannot heal naturally, although you can repair it in the same way as a Construct. If destroyed, it blinks out of existence.\n The Simulacrum obeys your every command without question, but this spell does not provide any sort of telepathic link. Those familiar with the original creature can make a Notice roll at -2 spot that something is off.\n In addition to costing a benny to cast, this spell also reduces the number of bennies you begin with each session by one, until such time as the Simulacrum is destroyed. The spell automatically fails if casting it would cause you to begin the next session with fewer than two bennies, or if the rank of the creature you wish to duplicate exceeds your caster rank.\n This spell requires a piece of the creature you wish to duplicate, such as a hair or a drop of blood.",
