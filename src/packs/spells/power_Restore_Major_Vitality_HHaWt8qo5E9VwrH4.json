    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and cures all Fatigue as well as restoring the target's traits. All spells and magical effects that reduce traits are automatically dispelled, and all trait damage is restored, both permanent and temporary, except that caused by death. This spell also removes all forms of Lunacy, confusion, and other mental effects, as well as permanent injuries such as missing limbs.\n If this spell is used to remove a Hindrance that was taken in return for additional points during character creation, the target has a choice: they can either keep the Hindrance (the spell is unable to remove it), or they can swap it for a different Hindrance of the same severity.",
