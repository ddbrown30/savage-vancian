    "description": "This spell creates an immobile opaque sphere of multicolored light the size of a Small Burst Template, centered on your location when the spell is cast. If the sphere would fully or partially appear over another creature, the spell fails. The sphere automatically blocks all types of attack (including mental and breath weapons) and spells, including your own; the only thing capable of passing through it is a creature (and its attended gear).\n Anyone other than you who passes through the sphere automatically suffers 3d4 damage (one die deals fire, one acid, and one electricity) and must draw an action card, resolving the result as if they had just been targeted by the appropriate spell, cast with the same spellcasting roll you used to cast Prismatic Globe (the creature may still attempt to resist the effect normally): Clubs is Ray of Weariness, Diamonds is Lunacy, Hearts is Petrification, and Spades is treated like Banish except it works on all creatures and always sends them to a random plane. On a Joker, draw two cards and apply both (if they both have the same suit, draw again until you have two different suits).\n The sphere cannot be dispelled, and even an Anti- Magic Aura cannot suppress it, although Disjunct Magic will destroy it. Anyone within 4\" of the sphere (other than you) who looks at its shimmering lights must make a Smarts roll or be blinded until they next draw Hearts for initiative.",
