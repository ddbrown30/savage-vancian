    "description": "This spell targets one creature or object: roll 2d10 damage, adding a further +d6 damage if the spell is cast with a raise. If this would inflict enough wounds to Incapacitate or destroy the target, they are immediately polymorphed into something of your choice, otherwise the spell has no effect on them (i.e., they are not Shaken and do not suffer wounds, they are either polymorphed or nothing happens).\n If the target is capable of Soaking, they may attempt to reduce the number of wounds in order to resist the spell. If the new form would prove fatal (for example, transforming someone into a fish while they're on dry land) they receive a +2 bonus to their Soak roll.\n The target replaces all of its traits and abilities with those of the new form, including mental attributes and skills. The duration of the spell is based on the difference between the original and new form, but is 5 minutes per caster rank for two unrelated forms. This can increase in steps to 15 minutes per caster rank, 1 hour per caster rank, 1 day per caster rank, or permanent.\n If both forms belong to the same kingdom (animal, vegetable or mineral) increase the duration by 2 steps. The duration also increases by 1 step for each of the following: both forms belong to the same class (mammals, birds, fish, etc.); both forms have the same Size; the Smarts of the new form does not exceed that of the original form; the two forms are related in some way (e.g., turning a human hair into a human being, or the figurine of a cat into a real cat).\n This spell cannot transform targets into a valuable materials such as precious metals or gems, nor can it turn the target into a magical item. However it can be used to duplicate the effects of Malevolent Polymorph, Polymorph, Petrification, Reverse Petrification, Transform Metal into Wood, Transform Mud into Stone, and Transform Stone into Mud.",
