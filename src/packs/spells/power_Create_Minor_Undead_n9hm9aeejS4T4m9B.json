    "description": "This spell animates up to one suitable corpse per caster rank as a skeleton or zombie. The undead are permanent, but your rank also determines the maximum number you can control at once; if you exceed this number, you must choose which of your undead are released (they will then wander off and do their own thing). This spell may also be cast on non-humanoid corpses, but they may count as multiple undead for the purposes of animating and controlling. See the 'Animated Minions' section for further details.",
