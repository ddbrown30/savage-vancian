    "description": "This spell fills a Medium Burst Template with a cloud of poisonous yellow vapors. There is a -6 penalty for attacking someone within the cloud, although the penalty is reduced to -2 if they are adjacent. When first cast, and at the beginning of your turn on each subsequent round, the cloud moves 2\" directly away from where you were when you cast the spell; everyone the cloud covers or moves over must make a Vigor roll (at -2 if cast with a raise) or suffer 2d6 damage.\n The cloud is heavier than air, and will sink to the lowest level, although it cannot pass through liquid. It dissipates when it moves beyond the maximum range.",
