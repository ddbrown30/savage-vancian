At Seasoned your familiar can communicate with you verbally, although nobody else can understand its words without the help of magic. At Veteran your familiar can communicate with other animals of a similar type (e.g., felines, birds, etc.). At Heroic your familiar gains +2 Magic Resistance, although this doesn't protect against spells you cast on it. At Legendary you can scry on your familiar once per day, as if you had successfully cast Improved Scry.</p></div>",
