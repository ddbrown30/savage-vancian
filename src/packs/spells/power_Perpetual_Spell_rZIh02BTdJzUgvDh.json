    "description": "This spell allows you to make one other spell permanent. You must first cast the spell you wish to make permanent, and then cast Perpetual Spell as your next action. Only spells with the Perpetuate trapping are affected by this spell.\n In addition to costing a benny to cast, this spell also reduces the number of bennies you begin with each session: Add up the number of ranks worth of spells you've made permanent, treating Cantrips as half a rank, and divide the total by your caster rank, rounding up. For example if your caster rank is Veteran and you have two permanent Novice spells (worth one rank each) and one permanent Seasoned spell (worth two ranks), you would begin\n\neach session with two fewer bennies than normal, dropping to one fewer benny when your caster rank reached Heroic.\n This spell automatically fails if casting it would cause you to begin the next session with fewer than two bennies. If a permanent spell is negated or dispelled, it is no longer included when calculating your bennies for the next session.",
