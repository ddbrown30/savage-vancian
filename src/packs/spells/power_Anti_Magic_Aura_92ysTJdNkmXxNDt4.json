The area moves with you and is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, magical abilities, and magic items. Magic cannot be cast or activated within the area, and any magic entering from outside is suppressed while within the aura.\n Summoned and incorporeal creatures wink out of existence while in the aura, although if they are already in the area when the spell is cast and have Magic Resistance, they can resist with an opposed Spirit roll. Other creatures are unaffected unless summoned, although their magical abilities are still suppressed within the area.\n The aura cannot be dispelled, but Disjunct Magic can destroy it. Two Anti-Magic Auras can overlap without affecting each other.\n</p></div>",
