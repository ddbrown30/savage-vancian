    "description": "This spell targets up to three creatures per caster rank: Undead cannot see, hear or smell the affected creatures. If an affected creature touches an undead creature, or makes any offensive action such as an attack, the spell ends immediately (not just for the one creature, but for everyone).\n Mindless undead are automatically affected by this spell, but intelligent undead may make a single attempt to penetrate the magic with a Spirit roll at -2 (or -4 if the spell was cast with a raise); even if they fail the roll, if an intelligent undead has reason to believe that unseen opponents are present, they will attempt to use other means to find them.",
