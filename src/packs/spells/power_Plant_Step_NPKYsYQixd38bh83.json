    "description": "This spell allows you to teleport between two living plants of the same type, regardless of the distance between them; you literally step into one plant and out of the other, therefore they must be at least a little bigger than you. This spell doesn't work on plant creatures, only normal plants.\n If you choose a specific destination plant which is no longer available (or alive), the spell simply fails. If you don't know of a specific plant at your desired destination, you may instead choose a distance and direction, and you will arrive at the closest possible location.\n You may bring along any object or objects you are physically able to carry, and up to one willing creature per caster rank, all of whom must be physically linked to you (either directly or through each other).",
