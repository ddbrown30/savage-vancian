    "description": "This spell requires one hour to cast, and removes the burden of sinful acts or misdeeds from one willing creature, who must be truly repentant for their actions. You only need to spend a benny to\n\ncast the spell if the creature committed the sins deliberately and of their own free will, as the removal of such sins requires you to call directly upon your deity.\n Redemption can restore divine spellcasting abilities that were lost due to committing sins. It can also remove behavioral Hindrances that were caused by magic (but not those taken during character creation).\n It is common (but not required) for the caster to assign the creature some sort of quest or penance before casting Redemption on their behalf.",
