    "description": "This spell targets one creature within range, who may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll; on a failure, they are banished to an extradimensional maze. Each turn, as a full-round action, the creature may attempt to escape the maze with a Smarts roll at -2 (or -4 if the spell was cast with a raise).\n The creature may escape with spells or abilities that allow travel between planes (such as Planar Travel), but not with abilities that work on the same plane (such as Teleportation). Once they escape, or after ten minutes, the spell ends and the creature is returned to its original location; if that location is occupied, they instead appear in the nearest empty location.",
