    "description": "This spell must be cast on a coil of rope, causing one end to rise up into the air until the entire length hangs perpendicular to the ground, with the upper end affixed to an extradimensional pocket. Anyone climbing the rope may enter an extradimensional pocket through an invisible 1x1\" entrance, and may also pull the rope up if they wish.\n Those within the pocket can see out, but spells cannot pass through the entrance in either direction unless they work across planes. Those outside of the pocket cannot see in - even if they can see the\n\ninvisible entrance, it just appears as an opaque barrier.\n The pocket can hold up to eight creatures regardless of size, or seven if the rope is pulled up. The rope itself can hold several tons of weight, but severing it or pulling it free does not end the spell. When the spell ends, any creatures within the pocket are immediately ejected.",
