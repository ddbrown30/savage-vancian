    "description": "This spell is treated as a touch attack (i.e., if successfully cast, add +2 to the result and compare against the target's Parry to see if you hit): if you hit a living creature, they suffer 2d6 damage, and must also make an opposed Vigor roll; on a failure, their Strength is reduced by 1 die step (to a minimum of d4).\n If you hit an undead creature, they must instead make an opposed Spirit roll or become Panicked.\n Strength reduced by this spell is recovered at the rate of 1 die step per night of rest.",
