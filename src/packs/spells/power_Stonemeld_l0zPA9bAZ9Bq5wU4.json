    "description": "This spell allows you to move through solid stone or rock without leaving any physical trace of your passage, as if you had the Burrowing ability with a Pace equal to your spellcasting die. You cannot move through other substances (such as loose earth), and the spell ends the moment you leave the stone.\n If someone significantly damages or disrupts the stone in which you're currently melded (such as by casting Shape Stone) you become Shaken (this can cause a wound). If they cause the stone to instantly vanish (such as by casting Disintegration or Reverse Petrification) you are also ejected from the stone, causing the spell to end.",
