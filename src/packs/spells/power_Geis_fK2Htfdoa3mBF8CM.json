    "description": "This spell targets a single living creature, who\nmay attempt to resist with a Spirit roll (at -2 if the spell is cast with a raise). If successful, you can command the creature to attempt to carry out one specific service, or refrain from one specific course of activity, as long as doing so doesn't result in the creature's death. The creature does not obey mindlessly, it will choose its own solution, but your command becomes its immediate and highest priority goal.\n The creature must do its best to follow your command until it completes the task, or until the duration expires, whichever occurs first. If it is prevented from obeying, it must make a Vigor roll each day to avoid Fatigue, as if it had the Major Habit Hindrance. The creature can recover one Fatigue level per day once it's able to obey the Geis again (or once the spell has ended).\n Dispel magic is not strong enough to remove this spell, but it can be removed with Break Curse, Limited Wish, Miracle, Sunder Enchantment, or Wish.",
