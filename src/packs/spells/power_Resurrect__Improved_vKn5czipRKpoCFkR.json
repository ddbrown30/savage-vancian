    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast and restores life to a willing creature that has been dead no more than 30 years per caster rank, even if their body has been completely destroyed, as long as you can unambiguously identify them (such as by reciting the time and place of their birth or death). Non-magical poisons and diseases are cured, the creature is no longer incapacitated, wounded or bleeding out, and all injuries (including permanent ones) are restored. This spell doesn't\n\nwork on Constructs, Undead (unless destroyed first), or creatures who died of old age.",
