You and those you designate can read the writing\n\nnormally, but it appears unintelligible to everyone else, and exposes them to a magical suggestion (like the suggestion spell except with a maximum duration of half an hour), which must be defined when this spell is cast.\n Unauthorized individuals can read the message using Truesight combined with either Decipher Magic or Empathic Comprehension.",
