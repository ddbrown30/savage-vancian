    "description": "<div class=\"swpf-core\"><p>You form a special bond with an animal of your choice; see the 'Familiars' section for the list of available animals. You can communicate with your familiar empathically over distances of up to a mile, but this only allows very basic communication.\nFamiliars understand the same languages as you, but cannot speak (with the exception of ravens).\nThe familiar is treated as an extension of its master. It has a Wild Die if its master has one, and shares bennies and wound levels (including wound penalties) with its master rather than having its own. If the familiar suffers wounds, it can attempt to Soak using its master's bennies, otherwise the wounds are automatically applied to the master (the master cannot try to Soak as well, nor do they become Shaken or incapacitated by any damage suffered by the familiar, or vice versa). Should the familiar suffer damage and its master doesn't have sufficient wound levels to take it, the familiar is incapacitated.\nIf both master and familiar are hit by the same area effect attack, they can each make a Soak roll with the same benny, and don't apply the wounds until afterwards (i.e., if one suffers a wound, the other won't treat it as a penalty to their Soak roll).\nEach familiar provides its master with a special Boon ability, while Sorcerers and wizards each gain a further benefit, as described in the 'Mage' section.\nYou can cast any spell on your familiar that would normally affect either you or them; range Self becomes Touch when cast on your familiar.\nShould your familiar die, it requires 2d6 days to summon a replacement, or a year and a day if you want a different type of animal.</p></div>",
