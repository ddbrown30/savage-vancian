    "description": "This spell causes time to stop for everyone other\nthan the caster. You can continue to act normally, are still harmed by effects such as fire, cold and gas, and cannot enter any area protected by an Anti-Magic Aura. While this spell is active, other creatures are completely invulnerable to (and cannot be directly targeted or affected by) your attacks, spells or actions, including any attempts to move or damage objects on their person. However you can interact normally with other objects, can cast spells upon yourself, summon allies (who are then frozen in time as well), and so on.",
