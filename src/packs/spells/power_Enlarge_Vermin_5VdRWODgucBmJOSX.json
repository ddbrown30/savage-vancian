    "description": "This spell targets up to one normal-sized vermin creature per caster rank, such as a centipede or spider, although you cannot affect multiple types of vermin with the same casting. Each creature has its size increased by one category per caster rank.\n Each size category increases the creature's Strength by +2 die steps and its Toughness by +2, but it also suffers a -1 penalty to all attacks, and attacks against it receive a +1 bonus to hit. If the creature is constrained or has insufficient space to grow, the spell automatically fails.\n This spell does not stack with other spells or magical effects that increase size.",
