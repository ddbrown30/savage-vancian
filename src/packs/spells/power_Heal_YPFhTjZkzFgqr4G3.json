    "description": "This spell automatically stabilizes someone who is bleeding out, and removes Shaken, Dazed, blindness, deafness, poisons, diseases, confusion, Fool's Fate and Lunacy, along with all temporary\n\ntrait damage. The spell also removes one wound and one level of Fatigue for each success and raise on the spellcasting roll.\n When used on undead, this spell is instead treated as a touch attack (i.e., if successfully cast, add +2 to the result and compare against the target's Parry to see if you hit, the +2 doesn't apply to the opposed roll): if you hit the target, they must make an opposed Spirit roll or suffer 2d10 damage.",
