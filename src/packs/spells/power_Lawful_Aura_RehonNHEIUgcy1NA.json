    "description": "This spell affects you and any number of other creatures you wish to affect within a Medium Burst Template centered on you, providing protecting against chaotic creatures and spells.\n Affected creatures become immune to possession (although this doesn't expel a spirit that is already possessing them), and Enchantment spells that allow control over the creature are suppressed (although not blocked or negated) for the duration of the spell. These benefits apply as long as the attacker has the Chaotic ability or uses a spell with a Chaotic trapping.\n Attackers with the Chaotic ability also suffer a -2 penalty to hit the affected creatures, and inflict -2 damage against them. They also suffer an automatic 2d4 damage if they attack an affected creature while adjacent to them.\n Finally, the affected creatures gain +4 Magic Resistance against spells with a Chaotic trapping, or which are cast by creatures with the Chaotic ability.",
