    "description": "This spell requires one minute to cast and restores life to a willing creature that has been dead no more than 3 days per caster rank, as long as their corpse is relatively intact. Non-magical poisons and diseases are cured, and the creature is no longer incapacitated or bleeding out, but wound levels and any permanent injuries remain, and the creature permanently loses an advance. This spell doesn't work on Constructs, Elementals, Outsiders, Undead (even if destroyed first), or creatures who died of old age or were killed by spells or magical weapons with a Death trapping.",
