    "description": "This spell creates an immobile sphere of shimmering force the size of a Small Burst Template, centered on you, which suppresses magic within its area. Spells and magical abilities of up to Seasoned rank have no effect within the globe, unless they were already in place when this spell was cast, although spells may still be directed through or out of the sphere in order to affect those outside. Creatures (including you) may freely enter or leave the sphere without penalty.\n The globe can be brought down by dispel magic, but only if explicitly targeted.",
