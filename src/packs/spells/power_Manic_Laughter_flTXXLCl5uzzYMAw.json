    "description": "This spell targets one sentient creature, who may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll (with a\n+2 bonus to their roll if they are from a different race or culture, due to differences in their sense of humor). If the creature fails to resist, they collapse into gales of manic laughter: they fall prone when the spell is cast, and suffer a -2 penalty to all actions for the duration of the spell. They are also rendered incapable of actions requiring speech, and find it impossible to move quietly due to their uncontrollable laughter.",
