    "description": "This spell opens one door, shackle or lock, resolved as if the spellcasting roll had actually been a Lockpicking roll (or Strength roll if the door is stuck rather than locked). You don't require lock picks, but any other penalties that would normally apply to the Lockpicking or Strength roll are applied to the spellcasting roll; if these penalties would turn a success into a failure, you can spend a benny to ignore them for this casting of Knock.\n If this spell is cast on an door protected by Secure Lock, you suffer a -2 penalty to your spellcasting roll (which is also ignored if you spend the benny); if successful, the Secure Lock is suppressed for ten minutes. Knock cannot be used to raise a barred gate or portcullis, nor does it affect ropes, vines, etc.\n If you spend a benny to turn a failure into a success, and the spell still fails to work (such as when cast on a fake door), you get your benny back.",
