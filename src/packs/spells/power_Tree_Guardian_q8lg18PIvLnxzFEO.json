    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and transforms a large healthy tree into a treant, who serves as a guardian. The tree must be within 48\" of the location you want it to guard, typically your home or somewhere you hold sacred. You do not control the treant directly, but it will protect the location to the best of its ability.\n You can only have one active Tree Guardian at any one time. When the spell ends, the treant roots itself to its current location and becomes a tree once again.",
