    "description": "This spell targets everyone within a Medium Burst Template; those who fail to evade with an opposed Agility roll become entangled. An entangled creature cannot move until it breaks free with a Strength or Agility roll at -2. Those who are not entangled must make a Strength or Agility roll to move through the web: each success and raise on the roll allows them to move 1\", up to their maximum Pace.\n The web provides light cover to those within it, and anyone with a source of fire (such as a torch or flaming weapon) can automatically clear their path as a normal action, allowing them to move through the web at their full Pace.\n This spell requires at least two diametrically opposed solid points to remain anchored, otherwise the web collapses and vanishes.",
