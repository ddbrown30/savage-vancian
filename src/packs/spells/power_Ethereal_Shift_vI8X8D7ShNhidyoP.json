    "description": "This spell shifts you to the ethereal plane, rendering you invisible and incorporeal to creatures and objects in the material plane. You can still see and hear things within the material plane, but only to a maximum distance of 12\".\n Abjuration magic and spells with a Force trapping that are cast within the material plane extend into the ethereal plane, and therefore still affect you, however the reverse isn't true; spells cast on the ethereal plane only ever affect other creatures on the ethereal plane.\n If this spell ends while you are in a solid object, you are automatically Shaken and pushed to the nearest open space.",
