    "description": "This spell grants you the ability to understand all languages, both spoken and written, as long as you are touching their source (i.e., the creature who is speaking or the document you're reading). You are not able to speak or write the language yourself, you can only understand the words of others, and only the literal meaning of those words.\n You cannot read magical texts with this spell, although you can recognize when a text is magical. This spell can also be foiled by certain warding spells, and does not decipher codes or reveal messages hidden within a text.",
