    "description": "This spell shoots a ray of dark crackling energy at the target, who may attempt to resist with an opposed Vigor roll. On a success against a living creature, the target becomes Dazed; each success and raise then inflicts one level of Fatigue, with incapacitation resulting in immediate death as their life-force is snuffed out. Fatigue from this spell is automatically recovered at the rate of 1 level every 24 hours. Against undead, this spell doesn't cause Dazed or Fatigue, instead it grants the target a +2 bonus to Toughness for the next hour.",
