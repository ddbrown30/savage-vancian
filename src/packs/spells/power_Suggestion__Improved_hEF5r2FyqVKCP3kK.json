    "description": "This spell targets up to one living creature per\ncaster rank within a Large Burst Template, each of whom may attempt to resist with a Spirit roll (at -2 if the spell is cast with a raise). If successful, the affected creatures will all follow one specific course of action, as long as the suggestion is worded in a manner that sounds reasonable and doesn't go against their nature. The suggestion should be no more than one or two sentences, and the creatures must be able to understand your words.\n If the creatures are able to complete the suggested action before the duration expires, the spell ends early.",
