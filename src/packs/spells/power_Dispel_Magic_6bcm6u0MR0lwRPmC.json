    "description": "This spell targets one specific spell, or all ongoing spells on one specific creature or object, or all spells within an area the size of a Medium Burst Template, chosen when the spell is cast. Each spell may attempt to resist with an opposed Spellcasting roll, using the skill of the one who cast it. Instant spells cannot be dispelled in this way, because the magical effect is already over.\n If you target a magic item and it fails to resist, it loses all of its magical abilities until its owner next draws Hearts for initiative (if it has no owner, simply draw a card for it each round).\n If you target an area, roll against every spell within the area that doesn't reside on a creature or object. Any creatures or objects within the area must only roll for their single most powerful spell effect in this case, not every spell.\n An alternative use of dispel magic is to counter another spell as it is being cast. This requires you to be on Hold and successfully interrupt someone while they are casting a spell; if your spellcasting roll equals or exceeds their spellcasting roll, you counter their spell before it can take effect. This also work on Instant spells.\n You automatically succeed at casting dispel magic against your own spells.",
