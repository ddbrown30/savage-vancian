If the spell is successful, the target is covered with a shimmering field of emerald energy which completely blocks all forms extradimensional travel. This doesn't affect creatures who were already ethereal when the spell was cast, nor does it block extradimensional attacks or senses, or prevent summoned creatures from vanishing when their duration expires.",
