    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and calls forth an elemental or other extradimensional creature of your deity's choice, with a rank equal to the rank of this spell. The creature is not under your direct control, but will perform a service for you if you can communicate with it and negotiate a suitable payment. You don't need to spend the benny for this spell until the creature has agreed to perform the service.\n The precise nature of the payment depends on the type of creature and the type of task: it could be in the form of another service or task, a donation to a church, direct payment in gold or magic items, or even some sort of sacrifice. As a very rough guideline, the typical cost is likely to be around 500 gp per rank of the spell for a brief task that requires no more than a few minutes, 2,500 gp per rank for a longer task that requires no more than a few hours, and 5,000 gp per rank for an open- ended task. This amount can increase or decrease depending on how dangerous the task is, and the creature will usually refuse a job that seems suicidal.\n The creature returns to its home plane once the service is complete, or if you fail to negotiate agreeable terms. This spell includes trappings appropriate to the creature, for example Unholy for an Unholy creature, Fire for a fire elemental, and so on.",
