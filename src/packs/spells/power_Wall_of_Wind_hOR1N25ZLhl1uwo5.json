The wall can be straight or curved, and can even form an enclosed square, but it must always be vertical. Gases (including gaseous breath weapons, air elementals, etc.) and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the wall, while ranged attacks suffer a -2 penalty to hit (unless they're extremely large, such as those fired by siege weapons).",
