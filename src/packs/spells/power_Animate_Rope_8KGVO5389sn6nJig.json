You can issue commands to the rope each round as a free action: it can coil itself into a stack, loop around something, release something, and tie or remove knots from itself. You can also use these options to grant a +2 bonus or -2 penalty to anyone climbing the rope.\n Although the rope cannot slither towards a foe, if thrown with a successful Throwing roll (with an effective range of 3/6/12) it can be commanded to tie them up; the foe must make a standard Agility roll (at -2 if you got a raise on the Throwing roll), on a failure they are bound.\n Escaping from the rope requires a Strength or Agility roll at -2: if successful the creature escapes but this consumes their entire action; on a raise they can also act normally.\n</p></div>",
