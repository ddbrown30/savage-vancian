    "description": "This spell conjures a wall of ice consisting of either a flat plane or a rounded hemisphere, chosen when the spell is cast. The hemisphere covers an area the size of a Small Burst Template, while the plane consists of up to 3 connected sections per caster rank, each of which are 2x2\" square and have Toughness 6. The plane must also be anchored in such a way that its weight is supported, for example a wall could be anchored to the ground beneath it, while a bridge would need to be anchored at both ends. If a section of the flat plane is destroyed, the freezing air remains, inflicting 2d4 damage to anyone who moves through it; this doesn't apply to the rounded hemisphere version of this spell.",
