Mindless undead affected by the spell can be issued simple verbal commands, such as \"follow me\", \"attack them\", \"guard here\", etc.\n Intelligent undead cannot be commanded directly, but their attitude becomes Friendly for the duration of the spell, or Helpful if they were already Friendly. This spell does not change their goals or allow you to control them, it just makes them view you in a favorable light.\n If you or your allies threaten or attack the undead creature, the spell is broken.\n</p></div>",
