    "description": "This spell renders the target creature and their\nequipment invisible, and surrounds them with a mobile sphere the size of a Medium Burst Template; all other creatures within the sphere are also rendered invisible. Those affected by this spell can still see themselves and each other, and remain invisible as long as they don't leave the sphere or make a direct offensive action such as an attack, but attacks and Notice rolls against them are made with a -4 penalty.\n If the main target of the spell makes a direct offensive action, the spell ends immediately for everyone. Creatures moving into the sphere after the spell has already been cast do not become invisible.",
