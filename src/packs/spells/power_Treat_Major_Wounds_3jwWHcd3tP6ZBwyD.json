    "description": "This spell automatically stabilizes someone who is bleeding out. Apply the target's wounds as a penalty to the result of your spellcasting roll: each success and raise removes one wound.\n When used on undead, this spell is instead treated as a touch attack (i.e., if successfully cast, add +2 to the result and compare against the target's Parry to see if you hit, the +2 doesn't apply to the opposed roll): if you hit the target, they must make an opposed Spirit roll or suffer 2d8 damage.",
