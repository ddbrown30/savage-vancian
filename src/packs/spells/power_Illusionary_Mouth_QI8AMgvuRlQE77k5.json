    "description": "This spell imbues a single creature or object with an illusionary mouth, which appears and speaks its message when a specified event occurs. You must choose the trigger condition (visual or audible only) and a message of up to 25 words when the spell is cast, and if the target is a creature or attended (or magical) object, it may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll.\n If the spell is cast on a target which already has a mouth (such as a creature or statue), their existing mouth appears to move when the message is spoken. Otherwise (such as when casting the spell on a tree or rock) an appropriate-looking mouth appears and speaks the message.\n A visual trigger can be keyed to anything a regular person might see, and is fooled by disguises, illusions and magical darkness. An audible trigger can be keyed to general types of noise, a specific noise, or a spoken word, and can be fooled by stealth as well as magical silence. The trigger can only respond to events within the range of the spell, and the events must also be within line of sight or hearing distance.",
