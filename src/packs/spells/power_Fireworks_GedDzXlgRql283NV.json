    "description": "This spell targets an existing fire, causing it to either erupt with a brief burst of blinding light, or a emit a thick cloud of choking smoke, chosen when the spell is cast. If the fire is non-magical, it is immediately extinguished by the spell, unless it exceeds the size of a Small Burst Template. If a fire-based creature is used as the source of the fire, it must succeed at an opposed Vigor roll or become Dazed.\n The burst of light fills a Large Burst Template. Those within the area may attempt to avert their gaze with a standard Smarts roll, on a failure they become partially blinded (like the Bad Eyes Hindrance); if they roll 1 on their Smarts die they are instead fully blinded (like the Blind Hindrance). The blindness lasts until the victim next draws Hearts for initiative.\n The choking smoke fills a Medium Burst Template and lingers for 3 rounds per caster rank. There is a -6 penalty for attacking someone within the fog, although the penalty is reduced to -2 if they are adjacent. Creatures within the smoke who need to breath must make a Vigor roll each round or suffer a level of Fatigue, as per the Smoke Inhalation rules in the Hazards section of SWD.",
