    "description": "This spell targets up to one willing creature per caster rank within a Large Burst Template, sending them into a berserk rage for the duration of the spell. The targeted creatures receive a +2 bonus to Toughness, ignore wound modifiers, and must automatically declare either Powerful Stance or Offensive Stance (or Wild Attack if you're not using the Stances rule) at the beginning of each turn.\n Creatures in a rage cannot perform actions that require concentration, and whenever they roll 1 on their Fighting die they hit a random target within range (other than themselves and their intended target).\n Note that the bonuses from this spell do not stack with the Berserker Rage (or Berserk) Edge, however any other Edges that are active while in a Berserker Rage will also apply while this spell is active.",
