    "description": "This spell allows you to the earth (including soil, sand and clay, but not rock formations) within an area of up to 125x125\", however it requires ten minutes to cast for each 25x25\" section. The earth moves slowly and fluidly without breaking the\n\nsurface, and doesn't cause damage to plants or buildings. You can raise or lower the elevation of the terrain by up to 2\", but cannot form tunnels. This spell is too slow to trap creatures, unless they remain in place for several minutes.",
