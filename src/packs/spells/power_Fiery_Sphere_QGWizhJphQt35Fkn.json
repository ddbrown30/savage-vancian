    "description": "You conjure a sphere of fire 1\" in diameter, which provides the same illumination as a torch, and inflicts 2d4 damage to anyone passing through it. The sphere has Pace 6 and you can move it as a free action, as long as it doesn't leave the range of the spell; if it moves into contact with someone, it automatically inflicts 2d4 damage, and cannot move again this round. The sphere cannot run, but it can bounce up into the air as part of its normal movement (although it falls back to the ground afterwards).\n Flammable targets who come into contact with the sphere must roll to see if they catch fire. The sphere can be extinguished as easily as a normal fire, leaving behind a soft spongy ball.",
