    "description": "This spell requires three rounds to cast, and causes one living creature to regenerate all temporary and permanent injuries, including severed limbs. The regeneration process requires one minute to complete, reduced to one round if all severed body parts are in contact with the creature when the spell is cast. The creature also recovers one wound and one level of Fatigue for each success and raise on the spellcasting roll.\n If this spell is used to remove a Hindrance that was taken in return for additional points during character creation, the target has a choice: they can either keep the Hindrance (the spell is unable to remove it), or they can swap it for a different Hindrance of the same severity.",
