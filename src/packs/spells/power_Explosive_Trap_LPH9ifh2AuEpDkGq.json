    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and targets one object that can be opened and closed, such as a chest or door. The trap is triggered when the object is opened, filling an area the size of a Small Burst Template centered on the object. Creatures within the area may attempt to evade with an Agility roll at -2, on a failure they suffer 2d6 damage (or 2d4 if triggered underwater). This does not damage the object.\n If Explosive Trap is cast on an object that already has a warding on it, the spell fails. Similarly, other warding spells fail if cast on an object that is already protected by Explosive Trap. Knock does not bypass the Explosive Trap, nor does an unsuccessful dispel magic trigger it.\n You and any individuals you attune to the spell when it is cast may open the object without triggering the trap. Optionally you may also set a spoken password, which can be shared and used to bypass the trap. Anyone examining the object for traps only spots the Explosive Trap on a raise.",
