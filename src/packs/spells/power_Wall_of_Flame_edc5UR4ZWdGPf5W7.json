    "description": "This spell creates either an opaque sheet of flame\nup to 12\" long per caster rank, or a ring of fire with a maximum circumference the size of a Small, Medium or Large Burst Template at Seasoned, Veteran or Heroic caster rank respectively; both versions of the wall are 4\" high. One side of the wall sends forth waves of heat that inflict 2d4 damage to anyone who moves within 2\" (this damage is only rolled once for their entire movement), while anyone moving through the wall suffers an additional 2d6 damage (every time they move through the wall).\n Any creatures standing where the wall springs up may attempt to evade with a standard Agility roll: on a failure they suffer 2d6 damage (if the wall is right on top of them) or 2d4 damage (if within 2\" of the hot side). Roll the damage again at the beginning of the caster's turn each round, except this time there is no Agility roll to evade.\n Each 1\" wide section of wall has Toughness 10, but can only be destroyed by cold damage, which causes the section to be extinguished; this does not affect the rest of the wall.",
