    "description": "This spell permanently warps or straightens wood, and affects up to 3 objects (each weighing approximately 10 pounds or less) per caster rank within a Medium Burst Template; anyone wearing or holding the objects may attempt to resist the spell with an opposed Spirit roll. It's possible to affect larger objects by treating them as multiple targets, for example a 50 pound object would count as 5 objects (and could even be warped over multiple castings).\n This spell can be used to force open a door, or wedge it shut. It can cause a boat to leak (by warping a plank), render a ranged weapon useless, or turn a melee weapon into an improvised weapon. Warped objects cannot generally be repaired (not even with an Improved Mend Object spell), but they can be straightened again with another casting of this spell.",
