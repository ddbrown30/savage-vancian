    "description": "This spell creates a mystical connection between you and the target creature. Whenever they would suffer two or more wounds (before Soaking), they receive half of the wounds (rounded up) and you receive the rest. If they would receive just one wound, then both of you become Shaken instead (this can cause you a wound, but not them).\n Shielding Link requires a pair of platinum rings as the spell focus: You and the target creature must each wear one of the rings. The spell ends immediately if either of the rings are removed, or if you and the target creature ever move further apart than the range of the spell.",
