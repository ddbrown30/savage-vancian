Those affected by this spell are also knocked prone, and if they strike a solid surface they automatically become Shaken.\n The wind also disperses fumes and gases, extinguishes small fires, fans larger flames, overturns delicate structures and small boats, etc. Any ranged attacks that pass through the wind suffer a -4 penalty to their rolls. The wind lasts until the beginning of your following turn.\n</p></div>",
