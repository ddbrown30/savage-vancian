    "description": "This spell covers a solid surface with slippery grease, and can be cast on the ground, an object, or a creature.\n \nIf cast on the ground, the grease covers an area the size of a Small Burst Template; all creatures within the area must make a standard Agility roll or fall Prone. Any creature entering or moving (including standing up) within the area on their turn must make a standard Agility roll, on a failure they fall Prone and cannot attempt to stand up until their following turn.\n If cast on an object, anyone attempting to use or pick it up must make an Agility roll, on a failure the object slips from their grasp. If the object is attended, the owner may attempt to resist the initial spell with an opposed Spirit roll.\n If cast on a creature, the target may attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll if they wish. A creature covered in grease suffers a -2 penalty when making grappling rolls, but receives a +2 bonus to escape from a grapple, grab, constrict, or similar maneuver.",
