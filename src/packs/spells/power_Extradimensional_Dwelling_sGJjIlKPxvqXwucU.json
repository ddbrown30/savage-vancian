    "description": "This spell conjures an extradimensional dwelling, with a single portal on the plane where the spell was cast, which you can open or close as a free action. The portal is invisible and incorporeal when closed, appearing as a shimmering field in the air to those who can see the invisible. The portal is also fixed in space, and may be forced shut by heavy objects being pressed against it (for example if you open the portal within the bows of a ship, it won't rip a hole in the ship, instead it will be forced shut when the ship moves through it).\n The inside of the dwelling is clean, fresh and warm, with an appearance and layout of your choosing, consisting of up to ten 2\" cubes per caster rank. The dwelling is fully furnished, and stocked with enough food and drink to serve a banquet for up to three dozen people per caster rank. There is also a staff of ghostly servants.\n Outside conditions such as weather and temperature cannot enter the dwelling, nor can conditions within the dwelling leave. Food eaten within the dwelling remains in the stomach of those who leave, but uneaten food, furniture, the servants, and any other part of the dwelling vanish if they leave.\n When the spell ends, everything that isn't part of the spell is immediately ejected.",
