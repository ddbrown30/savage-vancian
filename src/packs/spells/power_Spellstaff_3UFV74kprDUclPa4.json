    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and allows you to cast another spell you've prepared into a wooden quarterstaff, turning it into a spellstaff. You can only have one spellstaff at any one time, and it cannot store more than one spell at a time; attempting to exceed this limit automatically dismisses the previous spell. You may discharge the spell from your spellstaff at a later time, as long as you are holding the spellstaff; this is resolved as if you were casting the spell normally, except that it doesn't use up any of your spell slots. Your spellstaff cannot be discharged by anyone else, although they may use it as a regular weapon.",
