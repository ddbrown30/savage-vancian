    "description": "<div class=\"swpf-core\"><p>You gain the ability to rebuke undead a number of times per day equal to half your Spirit. This is a normal action with a range of 12\", and affects a number of undead equal to 3 times your Cleric or Champion caster rank, with the closest undead being rebuked first. Those affected must make a Spirit roll, on a failure they are immediately Shaken, and fall under your control if your caster rank exceeds their rank (you can control a maximum number of ranks worth of undead equal to half your Spirit). Issuing a command to an undead you control is a normal action, while voluntarily relinquishing control of one or more undead is a free action.\nThis Edge also grants you the ability to convert a prepared spell into a Cause Wounds spell of the same rank, as a free action.\nNote that a Cleric with the Holy ability cannot take this Edge, nor can any character take both Rebuke Undead and Turn Undead.</p></div>",
