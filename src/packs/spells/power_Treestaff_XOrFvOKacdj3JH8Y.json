    "description": "This spell requires a full round action to cast, during which you plant your staff in the ground. The staff transforms into a huge tree-like creature at the end of your turn (use the same stats as a treant Extra, except it cannot speak or control trees); on a raise the creature can act immediately, otherwise it cannot act until your next turn.\n The staff used for this spell must be prepared with a special ritual, requiring a full lunar month, and can be reused for multiple castings. If the tree-like creature is incapacitated, it immediately reverts back to a staff, and you must roll its Vigor as normal to see if it survives; on a failure the staff is destroyed.",
