    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and targets one object, or an area no bigger than a Small Burst Template. The trap is triggered when the object is opened or the area is entered, filling\n\nan area the size of a Small Burst Template centered on the sigil.\n Creatures within the area may attempt to evade with an Agility roll at -2, on a failure they suffer 2d6 energy damage. The type of energy damage depends on the trapping, and is chosen when the spell is cast.\n Alternatively, instead of an explosion of energy, the trap can discharge a harmful spell of up to Seasoned rank; you must cast this spell yourself, immediately after creating the sigil. This spell will target the intruder.\n You must specify which types of creature can trigger the sigil when the spell is cast, ranging from \"everyone except me\" to \"Unholy creatures\" or \"people not wearing red hats\". You may also set a secret passphrase if you wish; those speaking the phrase will not trigger the sigil.\n If this spell is cast on an object or area that already has a warding on it, it fails. Similarly, other warding spells fail if cast on an object or area that is already protected by this spell.",
