    "description": "This spell requires ten minutes to cast, and allows you to gain knowledge about the surrounding natural terrain to a range of 1 mile when above ground, or 20\" when below ground. You may ask up to three questions, and receive a detailed answer to each.\n You can obtain information about broad subjects such as plants, people, animals, rivers, caves, and so on, however the spell doesn't provide any information about settlements or other artificial structures (they are effectively invisible to the spell).",
