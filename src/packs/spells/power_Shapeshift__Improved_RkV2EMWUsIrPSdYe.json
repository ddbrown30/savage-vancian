    "description": "This spell grants you the ability to assume the form of any creature whose rank doesn't exceed your caster rank; you can change form up to once per round, as a free action. You retain your Smarts and Spirit, and skills linked to those two attributes, but replace all of your other traits, Edges and abilities with those of your current form.\n You may choose the creature's height, weight and general appearance from the normal ranges for their new form, and if you wish to imitate a specific individual you receive a +2 bonus to the disguise roll. Any equipment you are wearing that cannot be worn by the new form melds into your body (and becomes non-functional) until you assume a form that can use it.",
