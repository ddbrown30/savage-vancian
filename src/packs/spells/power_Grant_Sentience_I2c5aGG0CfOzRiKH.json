    "description": "This spell requires a full day to cast, and targets one animal or tree, granting them sentience; they will attempt to resist with an opposed Spirit roll (treat trees as having Spirit d4). A sentient animal removes the (A) from their Smarts, while a sentient\n\ntree will need to be created using the guidelines for plants in the 'Animated Minions' section.\n The newly sentient creature automatically begins with a friendly attitude towards you, although you have no special connection or control over them. They can speak one language that you can speak, chosen when you cast the spell.\n Note that sentient creatures cannot serve as familiars, animal companions, or similar. If they previously served in such a capacity, they are immediately freed.",
